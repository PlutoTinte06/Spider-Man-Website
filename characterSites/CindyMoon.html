                Bitten by the same radioactive spider that gave Peter Parker his abilities,
                Cindy was secluded in a bunker by Ezekiel Sims for nearly a decade because of her amazing powers.
                After being freed by Peter, she became known as the crime-fighting Silk. Her abilities are similar to Spider-Man,
                yet some of her abilities are unique to her. She is faster than Spider-Man and can easily outmaneuver him,
                but she is not nearly as strong as he is. Her spider-sense is much stronger than Peter's.
                Silk also has the ability to generate organic webbing from her fingertips, which she can also use to make clothing.
