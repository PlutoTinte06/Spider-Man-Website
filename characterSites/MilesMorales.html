            Miles Morales is Spider-Man! In his world the first Spider-Man was defeated and
            killed by the Sinister Six after taking a bullet. Miles who was bitten by a spider
            too a few days before, got the same spider-powers as Peter Parker with a few additional
            powers as invisibility or bio-electricity. Feeling responsible for not helping and Peter
            dying, he takes up the mantle of Spider-Man.
