            Gwen Stacy is Ghost-Spider! In this world Peter Parker never got bitten by a spider.
            After being bitten by a spider she developed spider-like powers. She was given a
            costume and a set of web-shooters by retired crimefighter Janet van Dyne.
            Gwen's influence also caused one of the biggest tragedies in her life. Her bullied best friend
            Peter Parker, desperate to be special like his idol Spider-Woman, turned himself into the Lizard.
            Spider-Woman was branded a criminal after fighting the Lizard, not knowing it's Peter and him dying
            in the fight.
